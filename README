At the moment, the host software will only work on Linux since it uses
/proc/stat to measure CPU usage. A planned upgrade is to use SIGAR or
something similar to get the CPU usage and make this cross platform. The
firmware can be compiled and flashed by using make assuming that avrdude
is installed on the computer that is doing the flashing. Some
configration will be necessary if the microcontroller type or clock
speed is increased.

The host and firmware software use separate makefiles. To compile the
firmware, run make in this directory. To compile the host software,
change to the host/ directory and run make.

The host software may be used by either running it as a normal program:
  ./ledcpu
or by running it as a daemon:
  ./ledcpu -d
It is up to the end user to decide to set up the host software to run
on computer startup.

If no host software is run on the computer, the firmware will go into an
"idle" mode where it cycles through all the hue values in the HSV color
space assuming saturation is full and value is full. The device will
immediately exit this mode upon receiving a command from the host side
software. Upon not receiving a command for several seconds, the firmware
will again enter "idle" mode.

The description of the files are as follows:
 - src/main.c - Main source file for the firmware
 - src/mixer.c - Source file for the LED color/pwm controller which is
                 driven by the timer0 interrupt (this is set up in
                 main.c)
 - src/ledusb.c - Source file for the device-specific USB driver
                  functions.
 - include/mixer.h - Header for the mixing functions in src/mixer.c
 - include/usbconfig.h - Contains the main configuration for the V-USB
                         driver
 - include/usbrequests.h - Contains the definitions for the usb requests
 - host/main.c - Contains the source for the host side software
 - host/opendevice.c - File that came with V-USB defining the functions
                       for using libusb
 - host/opendevice.h - Definitions for opendevice.c
